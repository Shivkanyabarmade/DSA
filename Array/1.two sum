Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

solution:We use a Map to store numbers and their indices.
Loop through the array nums.
For each number, calculate complement = target - nums[i].
Check if this complement already exists in the map:
If yes → return the index of the complement and current index.
If not found, store the current number with its index in the map.
This avoids nested loops and gives O(n) time complexity

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
   let map = new Map();
   for(i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
      let complement= target-nums[i];
if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }

        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }

   };
