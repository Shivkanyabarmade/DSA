ou are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.


algorithm: 



solutions:


class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
     int sum_s = 0;

     for(char &ch : s){
        sum_s= sum_s + ch;
     }  

     int sum_t = 0;
     for(char &ch : t) {
        sum_t = sum_t + ch;
     } 
     // sum_t > sum_s
     return(char)(sum_t - sum_s);
    }

};
