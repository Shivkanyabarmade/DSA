You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once for each word in words).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.


Count letters in chars

Use charCount[26] to store how many times each letter appears.

2️⃣ Initialize answer

result = 0 to store total length.

3️⃣ Loop through each word

For every word, create wordCount[26].

4️⃣ Count letters of the word

Increase count for each character in that word.

5️⃣ Compare counts

If any letter in wordCount is more than charCount → word is invalid.

6️⃣ Add length if valid

If valid, add word.length() to result.

7️⃣ Return result

Final sum of lengths of all valid words.
 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
