Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

The last word is at the end of the string, not the beginning.
There may be spaces after the last word, so skip them first.
Once we reach a letter, start counting characters.
Stop counting when:
We reach a space ' ' OR
We reach the beginning of the string.

ALGORITHM:
Let index i to last index of string.
Initialize length = 0.
While s[i] is a space:
Decrement i (skip spaces).
While i >= 0 and s[i] is not a space:
Increment length
Decrement i
Return length.

⏱ Time: O(n)
📦 Space: O(1)


SOLUTION::
Class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
      int i = s.size()-1;
      int length = 0;
      while(s[i]== ' '){
        i--;    
          }
      while(i>=0  && s[i]!=' '){
        length++;
        i--;
      }
      return length;
    }
};
