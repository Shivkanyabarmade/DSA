given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

 algorithm:

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".


Example 3:

Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".



Algorithm:
Find the index of the first occurrence of character ch in the string and store it in j.

Initialize a pointer i to 0.

While i is less than j, swap the characters at positions i and j.

Increment i and decrement j after each swap.

After the loop ends, return the modified string.


soln:
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        int j = word.find(ch);

        int i = 0;

        while(i<j){
            swap(word[i],word[j]);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return word;
    }
};
