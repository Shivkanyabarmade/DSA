Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

ALGORITHM:





APPROACH:Take the first string as the initial prefix.
Compare this prefix with every other string.
Shorten the prefix until it matches the beginning of the current string.
If prefix becomes empty → return "".
Why this works?
A common prefix must be a prefix of the first string.
Reducing it step by step guarantees correctness.

solution:






Time Complexity: O(n * m)

n = number of strings

m = length of the prefix

Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space used)
